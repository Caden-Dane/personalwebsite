  "text1": "I’m Caden. I’m 22 and someone who loves to keep learning and growing wherever I can. I’ve always been drawn to both the outdoors and tech — there’s something about the calm of nature and the creativity of technology that just fits who I am. One of my favorite ways to unwind (and have a little adventure) is flying FPV drones. There’s nothing like zipping through the air, pulling off tricks and seeing the world from a whole new perspective.",
  "text2": "I’m passionate about figuring out how things work—especially when it comes to processes, teamwork and agile software development. I love working with people, staying active and finding ways to get just a little better every day. If you ever want to talk tech, drones or just share ideas, feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to connect!",
